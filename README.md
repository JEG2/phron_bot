scraper.rb creates a yaml catalog of words from [Phrontistery.info](http://phrontistery.info)

Set your Twitter access tokens in twitterconfig.rb

Run pickaword.rb to select a word from the yaml catalog, tweet it, and log it. Uncomment the last two lines to delete words from the catalog after tweeting/logging and prevent repeats.
